**Issues with Control Interface**

- The outside interface does not light up when pressed
- The outside interface does not have audio
- The inside interface does not indicate the direction
- The inside interface does not have audio

**Explanation**

- If the interface does not light up, the user is unsure if the button was pressed properly
- If the interface does not have audio, the user is unsure if the button was pressed properly
- If the interface does not indicate the direction, the user is unsure if the elevator is
  moving the same direction he/she wants to go
- If the interface does not have audio, the user is unsure if the button was pressed properly
